Design & Development
--------------------

I like to make websites, and have spent most of my career doing so. I learned to make websites as a hobby, and in college I found myself a position making websites for professors. I started out working for [an agency in L.A.](/la/), then moved to New York, where I have worked on projects [as a freelancer](/freelance/) and as a partner [at Cantilever](/cantilever/). Eventually I made my way to Berlin, making websites with [Edenspiekermann](https://www.edenspiekermann.com).
