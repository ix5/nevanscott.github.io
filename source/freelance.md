title: Freelance Work

Some highlights include customizing Jekyll for [A Working Library](http://aworkinglibrary.com), designing and building a mobile-optimized site for [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com), and redesigning the [David Korins Design](http://davidkorinsdesign.com) website. Honestly, I'm kind of terrible at freelancing.
