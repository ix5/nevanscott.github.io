# Nevan Scott

Hi there! I teach design and web development classes at [General Assembly](http://generalassemb.ly/) and work with illustrators and editors at [Midnight Breakfast](http://midnightbreakfast.com/). Some of my previous work can be seen at [Cantilever](http://cantilever.co/work/).

You can also find me at [notated.org](http://notated.org/) and as [@nevan](https://twitter.com/nevan).
