<p class="lede" markdown="1">Hi there! I'm a [designer](/portfolio/) and [teacher](/teaching/), living in sunny Barcelona.</p>

* I teach a [UX/UI design bootcamp](https://uxui.cat) in Barcelona.
* I'm [writing about teaching](https://teaching.nevan.org) and open to feedback.
* I occasionally help publish a new issue of [Midnight Breakfast](http://midnightbreakfast.com/).
* You can also find me at <a href="http://notated.org">notated.org</a> on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/nevan" rel="me">@nevan</a>.


Teaching
--------

I've [always wanted to teach](/teaching/). Over the course of the past few years, I've been able to take on more teaching engagements, [at Noble Desktop](/noble/) and [at General Assembly](/ga/).

As part of my general tendency to overthink whatever I'm doing, I've been reading more blogs [about education](/education/) in recent years, which has been a real pleasure. Reading and practicing have allowed me to start forming some of my own thoughts about teaching.

Writing
-------

Mostly embarrassing, enter at my own peril:

Midnight Breakfast
------------------

I've been working closely with [Rebecca Rubenstein](http://rebeccarubenstein.com) and [Taylor Pavlik](https://twitter.com/FTPavlik) for the past year to get [a literary magazine](/publishing/) off the ground, with the help of [Lauren O'Neal](https://twitter.com/laureneoneal), [Ashley Perez](https://twitter.com/artscollide), and a [ton of wonderful](/midnightbreakfast/) [writers and artists](http://midnightbreakfast.com/contributors).


Design & Development
--------------------

I like to make websites, and have spent most of my career doing so. I learned to make websites as a hobby, and in college I found myself a position making websites for professors. I started out working for [an agency in L.A.](/la/), then moved to New York, where I have worked on projects [as a freelancer](/freelance/) and as a partner [at Cantilever](/cantilever/). Eventually I made my way to Berlin, making websites with [Edenspiekermann](https://www.edenspiekermann.com).
