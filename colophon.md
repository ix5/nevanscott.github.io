Body copy is set in [Chronicle][chronicle], Charter, Georgia, or your system's default serif.

Headers and other copy are set in [Whitney][whitney], your system's user interface font[^uifont], or your system's default sans-serif.[^webfonts]

Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), served from [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). Still using [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).

The following tools make my life tremendously more enjoyable and are strongly recommended: [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) for reading and highlighting the web, [Reeder](http://reederapp.com) for keeping up with the blogs, [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) to keep Reeder synced, [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) as a personal web archive.

No longer in use, but still loved and sorely missed: [Editorially](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/goodbye/) for writing and editing, [Readmill](http://readmill.com) for reading long-form.

[^webfonts]: Although I am enamored of web fonts as much as the next designer, I've decided that recent additions to popular font stacks that come pre-installed on most <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>es offer great options for legible pages at no cost to download speed. While I might not recommend this approach in every situation, this is my own space and I'll do as I please.
