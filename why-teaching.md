title: Why I Teach
---

I've had a teaching bug for as long as I can remember. I had really great teachers throughout elementary and secondary school. In 8th grade, I was part of a math club where I got to practice walking through approaches to problems with the 7th graders on the team. There were always kids who were quicker than I was, but I had an early knack for communicating ideas to others. In high school, one chemistry teacher even let me present[^1] a lesson one day. The first time I ever made any money, I taught kids' gymnastics over the summer.

[^1]: I also helped grade some papers, which makes me feel kinda iffy in retrospect.
