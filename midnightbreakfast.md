I really don't want to pick favorites, so I encourage you if you're interested to look through the [Midnight Breakfast archive](http://midnightbreakfast.com/archive). It's a true treasure trove. I've worked most closely with the illustrators, and spear-headed our decision to feature original illustrations with every piece we publish. I can't even get started on how incredibly lucky I've felt getting to work with so many amazing people, who take the time to read and respond to the great writing I send them, creating just beautiful visual additions to the site. I'm proud to say that we pay all of these contributors, and I'd be remiss if I didn't plug [our ongoing campaign](https://www.patreon.com/mbfast) to remain funded by readers.
