I started out teaching a workshop on developing custom themes for Wordpress, and went on to build a new workshop for them on responsive design. I really liked teaching at Noble, and still recommend it, but its classes are structured[^noblestructure] in a way that helped me get into teaching but didn't feel quite right for me personally.

[^noblestructure]: Classes take place in computer labs, and are very scripted. As an instructor, you go through a workbook with the students, demonstrating how to work through a section step by step before having the students work through the same section from their books. I can attest firsthand to how this structure helps keep up quality, and works well for the short format of the classes. In the end though, I wanted more freedom to plan and experiment, and a longer stretch of time with students to see how they learned and adjust accordingly.
