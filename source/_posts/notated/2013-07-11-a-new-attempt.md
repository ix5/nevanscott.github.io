title: A New Attempt
teaser: I'll write and publish when the mood strikes, and about whatever.

<p>I haven’t done anything remotely close to blogging in years, and truth be told, I’m pretty sure it’s because I always want to blog but am just bad at it.</p>

<p>This time, I’m gonna just go with it, warts and all. I’ll write and publish when the mood strikes, and about whatever.</p>

<p>I’m hoping that at this point I may have accrued enough experiences that I actually have something to write about. Whether it will be at all worth reading is a wholly different matter. I guess we’ll have to see.</p>
