If you're [getting into typography](/typography/), I've started to compile some thoughts. [Get&nbsp;started...](/typography/)

Tools

The following tools make my life tremendously more enjoyable and are strongly recommended: [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) for reading and highlighting the web, [Reeder](http://reederapp.com) for keeping up with the blogs, [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com) to keep Reeder synced, [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) as a personal web archive.

No longer in use, but still loved and sorely missed: [Editorially](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/goodbye/) for writing and editing, [Readmill](http://readmill.com) for reading long-form.
