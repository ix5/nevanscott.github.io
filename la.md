This was a real Baptism-by-fire experience for me, where I was launched straight into a major redesign of a commercial website for an international pomegranate juice brand.[^pom] I worked on the front-end, the back-end, moved the whole setup onto git to manage deploys, consulted on the user experience, and everything in between. It was a big project with a lot of late nights. I learned a ton.

[^pom]: A brand, I have to admit, that I had never heard of before working on the website.
