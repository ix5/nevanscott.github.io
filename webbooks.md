I'm fascinated by the web. It's so big and vast that it's hard to pin down much about it. To me, web books are an expression of what the web can be when it's at its best: access to ideas.

Here are just a few of the web books that I enjoy and share:

[<cite>Resilient Web Design</cite> by Jeremy Keith](https://resilientwebdesign.com)
: Keith covers a bit of the underlying history of the web itself, and makes one of the best cases I know of for taking a progressive approach to building for the web.

[<cite>The Shape of Design</cite> by Frank Chimero](http://shapeofdesignbook.com)
: Chimero writes about the "whys" of design.

[<cite>Practical Typography</cite> by Matthew Butterick](http://practicaltypography.com)
: Butterick's overview is probably the most comprehensive approach to typography available on the web. I find myself recommending [Typography in Ten Minutes](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html) to anyone interested in improving their typographic skills, and often share Butterick's advice on [Résumés](http://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html).

[<cite>Professional Web Typography</cite> by Donny Truong](https://prowebtype.com)
: Truong's treatment focuses more on typography as it is employed on the web. His section on [Practicing Typography](https://prowebtype.com/practicing-typography/) has some great examples of web-based typesetting.
