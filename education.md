title: About Education

My early favorite had to be [Dan Meyer's blog](http://blog.mrmeyer.com), which I got into after a friend sent me [his TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_meyer_math_curriculum_makeover). I also found myself really intrigued by Bret Victor's [Kill Math](http://worrydream.com/KillMath/) project. More recently, I've been especially taken with Audrey Watters' [Hack Education](http://hackeducation.com), Tressie McMillan Cottom's [tressiemc blog](http://tressiemc.com), Ben Orlin's [Math with Bad Drawings](http://mathwithbaddrawings.com), Sam Shah's [Continuous Everywhere...](http://samjshah.com)[^samshah], and [Jos√© Vilson](http://thejosevilson.com).

[^samshah]: Come on, just look at [these final projects](http://samjshah.com/2015/05/30/multivariable-calculus-projects-2014-2015/) from his multivariable calculus class. How could you not be jealous of results like that?
