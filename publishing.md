title: Publishing

Producing a magazine is another one of those lifelong goals that I'm tickled and honored to be partaking in. I became at least mildly obsessed with the idea of the web as a publication medium in the mid-90s. For a time in college, I worked on an alternative (print) zine with some friends, writing and doing layout for the internals. I later worked on the college newspaper's design, as well as its website. Meanwhile, I worked with [Elfie Raymond](http://elfieraymond.com) on the publication of long-form poetry in [The Language Exchange](http://v1.elfieraymond.com/ccorner/index.html). My biggest prior undertaking was a web magazine I launched in 2005 called Sadie Louâ€”which Rebecca and Taylor also worked on.
